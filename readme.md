# CRS Process API

## Introduction

This library provides a basis to develop process driven application where users and developers use the same API to define features.  

The goals are: 

1. Extendable data driven api
2. Allow defining and executing processes using code
3. Allow defining and executing processes using json

This allows application users to define processes for your system using json and execute them at will.
