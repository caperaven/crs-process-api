## function - getMouseInputMapthis function gives you back a object you can use to map input events based on mobile status. If not mobile mouse events are as they always are, but if not it uses the touch events.   This way you can still use the normal mouse events but on touch it would under the hood use the right map  **Returns**: {Promise<{mouseup: string, mousemove: string, mousedown: string}>}
